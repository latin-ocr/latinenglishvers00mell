HIMâ€š who of earth and ocean changed the way,
And sailed o'er land, and walked upon the sea,

We Spartans with three hundred spears did stay.
Mountains and seaS, ashamed ye well may be.

THE smoking camp fires on Eurotas show
O once inviolate, the advancing foe.

Birds, mourning thee, nest on thy treeless ground,
And wolves thine empty sheep-folds prowl around.

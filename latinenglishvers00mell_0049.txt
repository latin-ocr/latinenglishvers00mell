SING not Priam slain on altar stone,

Nor sad Medea’s woes, nor N iobe's‚
Nor in my verse does Philome} make moan

For Itys. Men have sung full oft of these.
Bacchus, sweet Love, the Graces are my theme,
And solemn faces do not them beseem.

THE Cnidian statue of herself

When Venus saW, she cried
‘Alackl where hath Praxiteles
My unveiled charms espied ?'

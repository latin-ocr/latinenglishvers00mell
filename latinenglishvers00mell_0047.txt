GIRL-POET sweet! like bee at summertide

She nectar sipt the Muses’ flowers among.
But grim Death claimed Erinna for his bride:
‘Thou’rt envious, Death' the girl herself had sung.

LTHOUGH you die so far from Nile, and find

Your grave in Eleutherne, blame not fate,
Philaenis; for from everwhere mankind
All by the one same road reach Pluto's gate.

ERE lies bride Baucis. O'er her tear-stained usn

Say to the god who rules the realrns below,
â€˜Envious art thou, O Death.' So all may learn

How to her sponse Fate dealt a ruthless blow.
That torch of pine-wood fired her funeral pile

Which should to her new horne have led the bride.
No happy marriage songs the ear beguile,

B11td1rges sad resound on every side.

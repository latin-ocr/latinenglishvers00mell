MAN by mad dog bitten, if they say sooth
In every liquid that same dog descries.
Then Love in me has fixed his rabid tooth
And now my soul a prey to frcnzy lies.
For thy dear form in rivers, in the sea,
And in the wine-cup shows itself to me.

NOTHER mark, O Cypris, seek

For there is not
In my whole body, free from wounds
One vacant spot.

'GAINST Love in Reason’s breastplate I'm arrayed,

Nor can the God, alone, o'er me prevail.
But should Love call in Bacchus to his aid,
One matched with two, what can Ι do but fail?

‘SHALL we go thus to judgment ?’ Pallas said,

When Venus clad in armour she espied.
‘Naked I conquer3 how much more with aid
Of shield and arms? she with a smile replied.

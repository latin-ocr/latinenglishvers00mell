IF thou art Spartan, mock at me no more,
Not I alone have fall’n by Fate’s decree.
Nor, Son of Asia, mourn, the wide world o'er
To Dardan rule each city bows the knee.
What though the jealous foe laid waste my home,
My shrines and battlements in days long past,
I’m Qeen once more. Do thou, my daughter Rome,

On Hellas’ neck thy yoke of bondage cast.

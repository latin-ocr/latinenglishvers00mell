CALM ocean darkling lies. No ruffling breeze
Whitens with crested waves the placid main.
And shattering on the rocks no swirling seas
Sweep headlong back into the deep again.
Soft Zephyrs breatheâ€š and ever you may hear
The swallow twittering o'er her straw-ghoed home.
Take heart and sai13 whether to Syrtes drear
Or to Trinacria's pebbly shore you roam.
But first to the Harbour God, Priapus, turn
And on his altar-fires red gurnards burn.

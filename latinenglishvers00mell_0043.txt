MYCENAE'S site though desert §ands bestrew‚
And now I'm naught but stones obscure to view,

I once proud Illium's battlements laid low,

And emptied Priam's house. Hence you may know

My former strength. If age my words belie,

Content with Homer's evidence am I.

INGED Love can break the winged boh of Jove
A stronger fire than fire itself is Love.

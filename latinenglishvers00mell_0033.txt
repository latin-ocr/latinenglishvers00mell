TO ROME.

HAIL, Ares' daughter, warlike Rome.
Gold-crowned‚ who in majestic state

Dwellest in thine Olympian home,
O Qeen inviolate.

To thee alone the Fates allow
To hold supreme unbroken sway,
So that, endowed with power, thou
May'st rule the world for aye.

Thy yoke is fixed upon the land,

Thy bonds upon the ocean grey3

Thou steerest with unfaltering hand
The cities on their way.

Almighty Time, who loves to end

All things, and moulds our lives at wil]

Doth still the favouring breezes send
Thine Empire’s sails to fill.

To thee alone is born, I trow‚

Of valiant sons a hardy breed.

Fair fruit, like Ceres, thou dost grow
From men, as she from seed.

O ZEUS of Scheria's holy plain, the fears

Of those who pray, their thanks too who rejoice
In answered prayer, for ever fill thine ears

With myriad eries. Yet hear, O hear, my voice.
To end my toil abroad true promise give
And in my native land O let me live.

NCE as the morning star your light
O'er living men you shed.

Now that you're gone, as Hesperus bright
You shine among the dead.

OUND his fish-trident Cleitor‚ worn and old,
Sick of sea-tofi, his weighted net did fold3
And to Poseidon and the salt sea’s swelling
Thus spoke, the tear-drops from his eyelids welling:
Thou know’st how penury to me has clung
persistent, and with pain my joints are wrung.
Stil] keep me, but on land, dear God, whose will
All things in ocean, and on earth fulfil.

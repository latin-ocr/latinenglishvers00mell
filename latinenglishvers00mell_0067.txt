HERE on Cyllenes high wind-ruffied hill

I, Hermes, stand, guarding the playing ground.
And oft with marjoram and daffodil
And violets fresh 1 by the boys am crowned.

THEY left their town alive, who died of old3
We living still our city's funeral hold.

HOPE wastes our lives. The last day dawns, and lo!
All our fine projects to the serap-heap go.

HIS snow on great Olympus' shoulder steep

The northwind spreadwhen down fromThrace it swe pt,
While ill-clad mortals shivered. Buried deep

Then in Pierian soil alive it kept.
Now mix some in my cup. No one would think

Of offering to a friend a tepid drink.

SK not whose tomb I am. May fate to thee
O mariner, grant a more propitious sea.

F stranger, as you pass, this tomb you see,

Although a dog lies here, forbear to laugh.
My master wept what time he buried me,

And with his own hand wrought this epitaph.

I’M old, but rich3 want gript me when a boy.
Both as old man and boy my case is sad.
So much I have now when I can’t enjoy,

And when I could enjoy then naught I had.

53

DEAR earth, remembering his long toil on thee

Let old Amyntas in thy lap recline.
In thee he planted many an olive tree.
Filled thee with corn, and prankt thee out with vine.
His water channels too to thee he led,
Whence fruit and herbs thy soil in plenty gave.
Then in return lie soft on his grey head,

And let Spring's flowery herbage decl< his grave.

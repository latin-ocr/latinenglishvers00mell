HIS little stone do I, as record true
Of our great friendship, dear Sabinus, set.

For you I’ll mourn. Kind fate forbid that you
Should drink of Lethe's stream and me forget.

'M down! Fierce God, place on my neck thy heel.

By Heav’n! I know how burdensorne thou art.
But of thy flaming darts no more I’ll feel

The burning‚ Naught but ashes is my heart.

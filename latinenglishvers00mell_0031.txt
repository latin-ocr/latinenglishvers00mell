SMALL God of small things Ι. And I will heed
If rightly called. Ask thou for nothing large.

But where a poor man‘s God the workers’ need

Can help, of this I, Tychon, have the charge.

MUCH sea I traversed, and the land, which bred

The pines to build me, burnt me to the ground.
Me safe and sound to shore the ocean led,
Falser than sea, my Mother I have found.

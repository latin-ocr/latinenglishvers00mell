WHY dread'st thou death, mother of rest and peace

Who from disease and want gives full release?
Once and but once she comes to mortals ass,
None e'er received from her a second call.
But we're beset‚ so long as life remains
By swarms of diverse maladies and pains.

DIODORUS wrought not this by hand,
He the Satyr hushed to sleep.

Up at once if touched he’ll stand,
The silver doth but slumber keep.

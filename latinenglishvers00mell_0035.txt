E hear Andromache of fate complain
And still see Troy to ruin reel and fall.
Th' onslaught of Ajax, and great Hector slain
By horses dragged round all the city wall,
In Homer’s song: the honour of whose name
Eastern and Western shores alike do claim,

IME filches all, and changes as it flits

Our names, our looks, our fortunes‚ and our wits.

ARD, hard is Love. But what does it avail
Repeating ‘Hard is Love’ to moan and wai] ?
Love only laughs. Reproaches fill his heart
With gladness, and revilings strength impart.
But how could you, who out of blue waves carne,
From water, Cypriam, give birth to flame?

THIEF found gold, and left upon the ground

A rope. Missing the pelf
He’d left, the owner took the rope he found,
And with it hanged himself.

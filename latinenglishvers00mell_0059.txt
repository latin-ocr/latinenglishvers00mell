OUR poet’s bones lie in Emathian earth,
All Hellas’ self bears witness to his fame,
Athens the crown of Hellas gave him birth,
And all men now his muse’s charm acclaim.

SHORT—LIVED am I and morta13 but when I

View the stars circling in their multitude,

1 spurn the earth, and, guest of Jove on high,
Feast on ambrosia, the Immortals‘ food.

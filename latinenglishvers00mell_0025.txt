HERMOCREON chancing on this trickling spring
Brought, water-nymphs‚ to you this offering.

Live on, and treading with your lovely feet

This damp haunt keep it full of water swcet.

HILE Thyrsis, Shepherd of the Nymphs, who can
Play on the pipes as tunefully as Pan,

Lies 'neath the pine at n00n‚ in drunken sleep,

Love takes his §hepherd’s crook and tends the sheep.

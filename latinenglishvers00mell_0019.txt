GO elsewhere, mice, if seeking bread ye come
I’m poor, and in a simple garret live.

Go where a rich cheese in some wealthier home
And scraps and raisins full repasts will give.
But my loved books with your sharp teeth if you

Attack once more your revel you shall rue.

HELIODORA of the lovely voice

In my heart’s inmost shrine
Soul of my soul, your own dear image stands

Sculptured by love divine.

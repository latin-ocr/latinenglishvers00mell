AN of the rocky heights‚ we brothers three
These §naring tools here dedicate to thee:
Pigres his tofis, Darnis his wild-beasts net,
And Cleitor his, still with the sea-salt wet.
So we thy favour may, we pmy, retain
In air, and oakwood, and the briny main.

ERE Ariadne sleeping lies;
From touching her refrain,

Lest springing up she should pursue
Her Theseus once again.

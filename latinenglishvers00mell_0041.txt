OF Heroesâ€™ cities few now meet the eye,

And those that yet survive scarce top the ground.
Thee too, Mycenae, lately passing by,

Naught but a grazing place for goats I found.
And one old shepherd pointing said, Behold
Here stood the Cyclops' city, rich in gold.

ER flower crown fades, which on her brow she bound3
Now shines my love with her own beauty crowned.

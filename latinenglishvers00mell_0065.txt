HE worn out ox, his gratitude to show,
Alcon refused to give to butcher's knife.

In the lush meadow grass, with joyous low
Free'd from the plough, it leads an easy life.

ORTUNE and Hope, farewell. I’ve found the port.
You're naught to me. Of those to come make sport.

ERE lie Nicander’s children. One fell day
Swept all Lysidace’s dear babes away.

O IVY, gently creeping oâ€™er the tomb
Of Sophocles, your fresh green tresses spread.

And all around the spot may roses bloom,
And grape-clad vine her pliant tendrils shed.
Dowered by Muse and Grace he did combine

In sweet-voiced song wisdom and charin divine.

BURIED here, Anacreon loved the vine3

O passer by, pour on my grave some wine.
